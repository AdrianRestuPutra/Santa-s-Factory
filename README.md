# Santa's Factory

This holiday, there're too many good kids in the world. As usual, good kids will get a present from Santa in this holiday. But before that, you gotta help Santa to wrap all the presents.

In Santa's Factory, there's no room for one mistake. Your job is to deliver each present to the correct place. Press [Left] or [Right] to move the pipe, then press [A Button] to push the present into the box. If you create a single mistake (Misplacing the present or one present got skipped) you will break Santa's Factory and many kids hearts since they didn't get any present.
